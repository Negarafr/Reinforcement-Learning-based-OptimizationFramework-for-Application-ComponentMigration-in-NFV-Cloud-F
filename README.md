# Reinforcement-Learning-based-OptimizationFramework-for-Application-ComponentMigration-in-NFV-Cloud-Fog Environments
In this project, a component migration strategy in an NFV-based hybrid cloud/fog system considering the mobility of both end-users and fog nodes based on Dee Reinforcement Learning is implemented. The code is inspired from "BinPacking_Neural_Combinatorial_Optimization" Model built by Ruben Solozabal. Readers are encourged to first get familiar with DRL based binpacking simulation code as DRLCM is a dynamic and more complex model. The following the Link to the bin_packing_combinatorial_Optimization code is provided.
